Point it at a folder and it tells you what's actually exploitable *(example output)*:

## What's included in Community Edition

Everything below runs locally, free, with no account:

- 🪙 **Web3 auditing** — core security checks for **TON FunC/Tolk**, **Solidity/EVM**, **Solana/Anchor** and **CosmWasm** (reentrancy, signer checks, replay, unchecked calls, access control…)
- 🔍 **SAST** — Semgrep + a curated rule set across common languages (Python, JS/TS, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby)
- 📦 **SCA** — dependency CVEs via OSV.dev with EPSS exploit-probability ranking, plus an offline fallback
- 🔑 **Secrets** — API keys, tokens and private keys detected in your source
- ☁️ **IaC** — Terraform, Kubernetes and CloudFormation misconfigurations
- 📄 **Reports** — SARIF 2.1.0 (GitHub Code Scanning), JSON and HTML
- 🔒 **Private by design** — fully local, no account, no telemetry

> Community Edition is a fast, practical scanner that catches the most common, highest-impact issues. Deeper analysis (full rule library, symbolic/formal Web3 analysis, auto-fix PRs, CI integrations) lives in **Pro / Enterprise** — see the table below.

---

## Usage

```bash
# Scan everything
tythanai scan ./myproject

# Only the checks you want
tythanai scan ./myproject --no-sast --no-sca   # e.g. secrets + IaC + web3 only

# Machine-readable output
tythanai scan ./myproject --sarif results.sarif   # upload to GitHub Code Scanning
tythanai scan ./myproject --json  report.json
tythanai scan ./myproject --html  report.html

# Quiet mode (findings + summary only, no banner)
tythanai scan ./myproject --quiet
```

Exit code is non-zero when findings are present, so it drops straight into CI.

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pip install tythanai-community
      - run: tythanai scan . --sarif results.sarif
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: results.sarif

## Community vs Pro / Enterprise

Community Edition is genuinely useful on its own. Teams shipping production smart contracts — and audit firms — upgrade for depth, automation and support.

| Capability | Community (free) | Pro / Enterprise |
|---|:--:|:--:|
| TON / Solidity / Solana / CosmWasm auditing | Core checks | **Full rule set + deep analysis** |
| Web3 symbolic execution & formal checks | — | ✓ |
| SAST rule library | up to 500 rules | **3,400+ rules** |
| Full CPG taint analysis (Go / Java / Rust) | — | ✓ |
| SCA (OSV.dev + EPSS) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Secrets & IaC | ✓ | ✓ |
| AutoPR — auto-generated fix pull requests | — | ✓ |
| AI-powered fix suggestions | — | ✓ |
| DAST (active web scanning) | — | ✓ |
| SBOM compliance (SPDX / CycloneDX) | — | ✓ |
| SaaS dashboard, webhooks, multi-agent orchestration | — | ✓ |
| Priority support & SLA | — | ✓ |
| Reports | SARIF · JSON · HTML | + SBOM · compliance |

**Need Pro or Enterprise?** TythanAI Pro is built for teams and audit firms running TON / Solana / Solidity engagements. To request access or a demo, [open an issue](https://github.com/TythanAI/TythanAIOpen/issues/new) or visit [tythanai.io](https://tythanai.io).
